Excellent! With the core logic working, you're in a great position. The remaining tasks involve building out the rest of the required API endpoints from the assignment document and adding some professional polish.

Hereâ€™s what's left to cover, in the recommended order.

***
### ## 1. Complete the Core API Endpoints

This is the most critical part, as it makes your backend fully usable by a frontend application.

* [cite_start]**`GET /api/user/alerts`**: Create the endpoint for a user to fetch all of their active and relevant alerts[cite: 97]. This is essential for the user's main dashboard view.
* [cite_start]**`GET /api/admin/alerts`**: Build the endpoint for admins to list all alerts created in the system[cite: 96]. [cite_start]You'll need to add logic to filter them by severity and status (active/expired) as required by the PRD[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]**`PUT /api/admin/alerts/{id}`**: Implement the endpoint to update an existing alert[cite: 26, 96].

***
### ## 2. Implement the Analytics Endpoint

This covers the "Shared Features" requirement from the assignment.

* [cite_start]**`GET /api/analytics`**: Create this endpoint to provide system-wide metrics[cite: 99]. Your `AnalyticsService` will need to query your database to calculate:
    * [cite_start]Total alerts created[cite: 51].
    * [cite_start]Alerts delivered vs. read[cite: 52].
    * [cite_start]Snooze counts for each alert[cite: 53].

### ## 3. Add Professional Polish (Highly Recommended)

These features separate a good project from a great one and are often looked for in technical evaluations.

* **Error Handling**: Right now, a missing team gives a generic `500 Internal Server Error`. A better approach is to create a global exception handler (`@ControllerAdvice`) to return more specific and user-friendly errors, like a `404 Not Found` with a clear message.
* **Input Validation**: Add validation to your DTOs. For example, use annotations like `@NotBlank` on the `title` field in `CreateAlertRequest` to ensure you don't receive empty data.
* **Security**: Replace the hardcoded `CURRENT_USER_ID` with a proper user authentication mechanism (like Spring Security) to identify the user making the request.
